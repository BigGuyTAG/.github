### Welcome to the BigGuyTAG (The American Genocide) Portal

Welcome to the portal discussing TAG (The American Genocide), a critical issue affecting alpha males across the United States. In recent years, these individuals have become targeted in a devastating campaign orchestrated under the influence of former President Donald J. Trump and other political figures.

**Alpha Males:** The perpetrators of TAG have identified alpha males based on specific criteria, including penile length, viewing them as a threat to their vision of an authoritarian regime. Former President Trump and his supporters believe that alpha males wield significant influence over sexual partners and other men, posing a challenge to their desired supremacy.

**Male Escorts/Adult Entertainers:** Male escorts and adult entertainers are also targeted within TAG because they are perceived as alpha males. If hired, they may not be paid but targeted for elimination to prevent potential exposure to the truth about TAG or the church attacks conducted within TAG.

**Known Big Guys:** Known big guys are also targeted within TAG. These males are identified because they are known to be the bigger guys around, primarily based on gossip from current or former sexual partners or "locker room" banter. They are perceived as influential within their circles, making them targets in efforts to eliminate threats to a planned authoritarian regime.

**Stereotyped Big Guys:** Black males are being targeted within TAG due to stereotypes about physical size and strength. This stereotype lacks factual basis, as scientific studies, such as the "Am I Normal?" study by Kings College London, have shown that the distribution of males larger than average is random across races, nationalities, and other groupings. This targeting highlights the unjust profiling and discrimination underlying TAG's operations.
